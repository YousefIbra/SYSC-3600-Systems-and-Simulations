# SYSC-3600

**Course Objectives:**

This course provides an introduction to the techniques of system modeling, analysis and simulation. One
will learn how to predict the behaviour of dynamic systems to various inputs. Knowledge gained from
previous courses on mechanical and electrical systems and differential equations is integrated to provide
an understanding of the dynamic behaviour of engineering systems. The topics to be covered include:
modeling of dynamic systems, the properties of dynamic systems, the use of Laplace transforms, transfer
functions and block diagrams, convolution and time and frequency response.

**Learning Outcomes:**

The students should be able to model lumped parameter dynamic systems and draw and reduce simulation
diagrams. The students should understand the time response of first, second and higher order systems.
The students should be able to derive transfer functions in the Laplace domain and understand from the
locations of poles and zeros what the dynamic response will be. The students should be able to sketch
accurate Bode diagram in the frequency domain and relate the diagrams to physical behavior of the
system.
